What is DeckMakeTool
It uses Python to convert 60 images into a single image of 10 horizontal and 6 vertical, and then into a 1-second MP4 video of 4320 pixels wide.
You can use this to bring your own Pok√©mon Card deck into the VRChat world.

How to use
1. Add 60 card images (.jpg) of the appropriate deck to the "input" folder. Do not place jpg images other than those.
2. Run "deckmake.bat".
3. MP4 movies will be output to the "output" folder.
